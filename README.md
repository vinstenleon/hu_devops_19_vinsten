Documentation of steps :

1) Created ssh keys and added it to my github ssh keys

   To create the keys i used ssh-keygen and generated a rsa encrpyted key.
   I copied the public key to my github account

2) I made a repo on github hu_devops_19_vinsten and cloned it using git clone on my system

3) Then i made a new branch git-assignment using git checkout -b git-assignment

4) Created a file named secrets.txt with username and password and used .gitignore to prevent git from tracking

5) Then security.md file was made which consisted of how the secrets.txt file was handled
